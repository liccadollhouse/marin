The Marin cosplay contest manager, originally written for AnimeFest/GameFest/World Fandom.

I wrote this using Python and Django because I was sick of the sheer amount of paperwork needed to run a cosplay contest, and I wanted something that I can very cheaply implement with extremely low-end Linux hardware.
